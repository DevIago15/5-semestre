    <h1>Movie Plot</h1>
    <p>In October 2003, Mark Zuckerberg, a young academic at Harvard University, was outraged when his girlfriend, Erica Albright, took to a forum after questioning her egocentric behavior.
        Upon returning to the student dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his personal LiveJournal blog. After hacking and using the university's servers, he created a website called Facemash,
        where site visitors voted and rated the attractiveness of female students; traffic on the site is so large that Harvard's computer network shuts down due to overload. Zuckerberg is punished by the rectory with six months of academic suspension,
        but the popularity of Facemash attracts the attention of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, athletes and leaders of a fraternity at the institution, who together with their business partner Divya Narendra, invite Zuckerberg to work on the Harvard Connection project, a dating site exclusively for students. of the institution.
        Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin, a Brazilian Economics student, with an idea called The Facebook, a social network for Ivy League college students; Saverin agrees to deposit $1,000 in seed funding for the project, allowing Zuckerberg to build the site, which will quickly become popular.
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon finding out about The Facebook, Narendra and the Winklevoss twins are furious, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while tricking them into paralyzing
        the development of the Harvard Connection; When they take their complaint to Dean Larry Summers, he dismisses the complaint, declaring that disciplinary action against The Facebook would be a waste of time.
        Saverin and Zuckerberg meet a classmate named Christy Lee, who praises them for the project and says "Facebook me", a phrase that leaves them impressed.
        As the social network grows in popularity, Saverin has increased his funding in the project, allowing Zuckerberg to expand his reach to Yale, Columbia and Stanford universities. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet with Sean Parker, co-founder of the website Napster;
        This one tells them that the company has the potential to be worth a billion dollars, it also suggests renaming the website to just Facebook. Zuckerberg is impressed, but Saverin considers him paranoid and narcissistic. Zuckerberg moves the company to California, following Parker's advice,
        while Saverin remains in New York to obtain partnerships and advertisers for the business. Parker moves into Zuckerberg's base of operations and becomes more involved with the company, which upsets Saverin.
    </p>

    <p>
        In England, while representing Harvard at the Royal Henley Regatta, the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded into Europe, gaining users in Oxford, Cambridge, and the LSE;
        together with Narendra, they decide to sue the company for intellectual property theft. Meanwhile, tired of Parker leading business decisions for Facebook, Saverin freezes the company's bank account,
        but changes his mind when Zuckerberg informs him that mega-investor Peter Thiel has agreed to participate in the project, injecting extra capital of 500 thousand dollars. Saverin signs a new partnership agreement, promising a 34% stake in Facebook shares;
        Upon discovering that in reality his stake has been reduced to just 0.03% and his co-founder title stripped from the site, Saverin is furious and confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, vowing to prosecute them for fraud before being thrown out of the building. After the site reaches the 1 million user mark,
        Parker and some interns are arrested for possession of cocaine during a celebration party. Parker tries to blame Saverin for the incident, but Zuckerberg decides to cut ties, telling him to "go home".
    </p>

    <p>
        In separate testimony at the court meeting, the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims that his participation in the
        Facebook was unfairly diluted during the company's construction. After discussions between the parties' representatives, Marylin Delpy, Zuckerberg's defense lawyer,
        informs him that an agreement will be reached with the plaintiffs, as the sordid details about Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's egocentric attitude would make him unsympathetic before a popular jury, which would result in more losses.
        Alone in the room, Zuckerberg discovers Albright's Facebook profile, sends her a friend request, and refreshes the page repeatedly. In the end, it is revealed to the viewer that the Winklevoss twins signed a 65 million dollar deal,
        including a confidentiality agreement, and rowed for the USA at the Beijing Olympics, placing 6th. Eduardo Saverin received an unknown amount, but his name was restored to Facebook's public records as a co-founder. Facebook reached 500 million users in 207 countries, with a value of 25 billion dollars at the time,
        which made Mark Zuckerberg the youngest billionaire in the world.
